# üè¢ Rental Lease Optimization App

A web-based tool built with Streamlit and PuLP to optimize rental property lease plans based on various client requirements and property constraints. This application leverages Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to find the most cost-effective solutions.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Flexible Property Data Input:**
    * Generate random property data for quick testing.
    * Upload your own property details via a CSV file with a predefined format.
    * Download a sample CSV to understand the expected input structure.
* **Customizable Client Requirements:**
    * Specify target units required for the lease.
    * Set a minimum cost target (budget) with an upper tolerance.
    * Define the lease period (start and end dates).
* **Advanced Optimization Controls:**
    * **Full Property Penalty:** Penalize solutions that lease only a portion of a property's available units.
    * **Group Constraints:** Ensure a minimum number of properties are selected from specific property groups (e.g., specific geographical areas, property types).
    * **Occupancy Rating Penalty:** Discourage selecting properties with high existing occupancy ratings by applying a penalty.
    * **Pre-selected Properties:** Force specific properties to always be included in the lease plan.
* **Solver Tuning:**
    * Set time limits for the optimization solver to ensure quick responses.
    * Define an optimality gap tolerance to balance solution quality and computation time.
* **Multiple Solutions:** Generate and compare several distinct optimal or near-optimal lease plans.
* **Clear Output Summary:** Detailed breakdown of each optimized plan, including costs, units, penalties, and constraint fulfillment status.
